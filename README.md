**Blind 75** is a term often used in competitive programming and coding interviews. It refers to a curated list of 75 coding problems or questions that cover a wide range of topics and difficulty levels. These problems are commonly used by candidates preparing for technical interviews at tech companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and others.

The purpose of the Blind 75 list is to help candidates practice and improve their problem-solving skills in preparation for coding interviews. The problems cover various data structures, algorithms, and concepts such as arrays, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming, graphs, sorting, searching, and more.

Candidates often work through these problems to build their coding proficiency, problem-solving intuition, and familiarity with common algorithms and techniques. It's a valuable resource for anyone looking to excel in technical interviews and land a job in the tech industry.

It's important to note that the specific list of Blind 75 problems may evolve over time, and candidates may also encounter similar lists with different problem sets. It's a good idea to keep up to date with the latest resources and problem sets to ensure comprehensive interview preparation.
