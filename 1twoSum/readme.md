## Two Sum
Don't open the solution file directly. Instead, I've provided some hints to help solve the problem. Even if you can't solve the problem, I've provided a pseudocode-like structure for the complete solution at the end. Read it, try to implement it on your own, and then compare it with my actual solution to see how you did.

## question 
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```
```
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```
```
Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```
